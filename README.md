Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
For this project, we were provided with the code to create the "Pirate Game". Our goal was to create an algorithm capable of solving these mazes with as little moves as possible. To do this, I created a system to reward the algorithm for winning the game in as little moves as possible to encourage it to quickly finish.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist create almost everything in the technology field. From hardware to the software running on that hardware, computer scientists are the reason we have such a digital world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I need to solve a problem, I like to break the problem apart into little pieces to make it easier to understand. Sometimes large tasks can be daunting and almost discouraging at times, but taking a step back and looking at the problem in pieces seems to help every time. Using something like a design document is also very invaluable.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The ethical responsibilities that I have are to ensure that user's are safe. This means that any data being taken must not be leaked to anyone or anything else. Working with AI and these algorithms is a very touchy subject especially when it comes to data collection. AI can qucikly move a lot of data without you ever realizing so keeping users safe is the number one priority.
